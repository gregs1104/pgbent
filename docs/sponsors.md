# Sponsor notes

_pgbent_ was supported from 2019-2025 by a generous time allocation from [Crunchy Data](https://www.crunchydata.com/).  In June 2025 Crunchy Data was acquired by Snowflake, and the project's ongoing work on PG18 testing completed under their sponsorship.

From project inception on PG8.2/2006 to PG17/2024, all the hardware for the original code (as _pgbench_tools_) development period was personally supplied by Greg Smith, to keep the work independent of employer entangement and vendor influence.  For 2025, Crunchy Data supplied an Apple Silicon M4 MacBook Pro system with 128GB of RAM, the amount needed to do well on the Open Street Map tests, for evaluation under PG17 and then PG18.
